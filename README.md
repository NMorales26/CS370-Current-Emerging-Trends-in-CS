Portfolio Reflection Journal: Pirate Intelligent Agent Project

1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was given starter code that included two Python files, `TreasureMaze.py` and `GameExperience.py`, as well as a Jupyter Notebook named `TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`. The provided files handled the maze environment, game logic, and experience replay system. My main task was to complete the deep Q-learning algorithm in the notebook by implementing the `qtrain()` function. This involved managing training epochs, balancing exploration and exploitation, storing past experiences, training the neural network model, and evaluating its performance until a high win rate was achieved.

2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing algorithms, building software systems, and applying theory to practical challenges. Their work enables innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, healthcare, and education. It matters because these solutions power much of the technology that drives modern society.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and breaking the problem into manageable parts. I identify the inputs and outputs, analyze possible algorithms, test different approaches, and refine the solution iteratively. In this project, I applied that approach by studying the provided codebase, understanding how the environment and replay memory worked, and then implementing and refining the training algorithm.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include ensuring the systems I develop are reliable, transparent, and fair. I must protect user data and privacy, prevent biases in algorithmic decisions, and make design choices that prioritize the user’s well-being and trust. Even in simulated environments like this game, these principles apply—highlighting how design decisions can shape outcomes and user experience. Ethical thinking is essential to maintaining integrity and accountability in the tech industry.
